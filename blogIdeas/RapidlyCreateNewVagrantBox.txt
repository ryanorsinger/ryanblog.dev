Quicky way to make a new vagrant box
copy an existing vagrant folder to a newFolder/

$cd ~/
$ cp -r ~/vagrant-lamp newFolder/

(be sure to add the / after the foldername)
(prune out anything that doesn't need to be there)

$ cd newFolder/
$ ls -la
$ rm -rf .vagrant

$ vim VagrantFile 
and change the hostname to newBoxname or whatever

from your newFolder/
$ vagrant up

then the newBoxname provisions and boots
don't worry if you get a puppet error. 

Vagrant will launch virtual box and provision a clone of a different name of your vagrant box
---

the newFolder/ vagrant directory is linked/synced w/ symbolic link to 
/vagrant/ on the VM for newBoxname


Modify config, environment, and such as necessary.
Add virtual hosts as necessary
