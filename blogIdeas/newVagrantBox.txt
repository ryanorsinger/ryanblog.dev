Quick way to make a new vagrant box
copy an existing vagrant folder to a newFolder/

using iTerm on your mac,

$ cd ~/
$ mkdir newFolder
$ cp -r ~/vagrant-lamp newFolder/

(be sure to add the / after the foldername)

$ cd newFolder/
$ ls -la
$ rm -rf .vagrant
// this is so that when you type "vagrant up", vagrant will create a new box

$ vim VagrantFile 
and change the hostname to newBoxname or whatever you'd like to name the new virtual box. Quantal2 is a good option.
inside of vim, hit the letter i to enter INSERT mode. Then change the hostname's boxname. then hit ESC and type colon followed by wq to quit.
You could also open VagrantFile up in Sublime to accomplish this w/o messing with vim.

from your newFolder/
$ vagrant up

then the newBoxname provisions and boots
don't worry if you get a puppet error about removing mount files...

Vagrant will launch virtual box and provision a clone of a different name of your vagrant box

Now you have a copy of the vagrant box we used in CodeUp. You can mess it up and do Rails on it and go hog wild. 
from your newFolder/

do vagrant ssh and it will drop you into newBoxname in the home folder.
like usual, cd /vagrant/ and you will go to the see that /vagrant/ on your newBox links and syncs with your newFolder/ on your Mac!

You will see a copy of everything that existed in your /vagrant-lamp/ directory. 

You will need to modify apache virtual hosts to create local dev sites like newproject.dev or whatnot.

P.S. Manage virtual boxes from the VirtualBox app. Recommend using only one virtual box at a time for resources and also so there aren't any port conflicts.
