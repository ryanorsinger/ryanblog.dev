Laravel's default status is production. That's good to know. But I want my local development to have debugging turned on and other features enabled as well.
Here's how we do it.

In our laravel instance, go to /bootstrap/start.php
Find the | "Detect The Application Environment" section.

$env = $app->detectEnvironment(function(){
    return $_SERVER['LARAVEL_ENV'] == 'local' ? 'local' : 'production';
    
    });
    
Now go to your virtual host on your vagrant box 

and add "SetEnv LARAVEL_ENV local". Now restart apache.
